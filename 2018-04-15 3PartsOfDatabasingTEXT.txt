HI, THIS PRESENTATION IS ABOUT,
The three parts of working with data, THAT INTEREST ME, THE MOST.

First of all, data entry.
The first point at which information enters a system from the outside world.
Be if from a business, or any kind of study, like for example the weather or traffic.

Then I'm really interested in the many different ways this data is stored.
In what we call, database systems.
We have relational database systems, NoSQL databases, etcetera.

And finally, I'm very interested in how data analysed.
Business Intelligence, Analytics, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics,
Are all very exciting areas of IT, that are continually growing.

You can make a whole career out of any one of these areas.
I indeed have, mostly with the middle layer.
